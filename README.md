# ECG Compression Benchmark

This repository contains the code and resources for the ECG Compression Benchmark, a platform for evaluating ECG signal compression algorithms.

## Project Structure
- **`competition.yaml`**: Configuration file for the benchmark.
- **`input_data/`**: Contains ECG signal data in `.mat` format.
- **`ingestion_program/`**: Scripts to run participant submissions.
- **`scoring_program/`**: Scripts to evaluate results and compute metrics.
- **`starting_kit/`**: Example submission based on the B-spline compression algorithm.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JessieXu959/ECG-Compression-Benchmark.git
